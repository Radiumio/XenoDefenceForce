*Publically, not much is known about the XDF - even their existence and size is a well-kept secret. Having operated for several decades, the XDF emerged at the same time as the alien threat, formed by a multinational coalition between the leaders of several powerful countries. Despite political tensions, the threat of alien invasion has forced those aware of the danger to set aside their differences, and work to stop our extraterrestrial enemy.

As is necessary for such an organisation, the XDF employs some of the world's brightest minds in order to study the alien threat. Many of the foreign technologies recovered in the field have been used to develop hybrid weapons and equipment used by XDF operators, and create powerful variants of modern aircraft and ground vehicles that are capable of standing up to their otherworldly opponents. It is believed that the XDF operates in independent cells, so as to avoid being toppled by evasive alien infiltrators or moles.

Despite this unlikely show of collaboration, the threat of alien invasion grows ever closer. Panic spreads throughout the world as localized alien incursions become more frequent. Tensions between global powers are increasing - all orchestrated by our extraterrestrial neighbours who aim to secure our planet. If nothing is done, humanity is certainly doomed to go extinct. The XDF must act.*

Xeno Defence Force is a retexture mod heavily inspired by the Xenonauts video game, and focuses on a fictional organisation that undertakes clandestine operations and research to counter an extraterrestrial threat. On top of re-theming vanilla vehicles, several vehicles have also receiving changes to their handling, armor and more.

As of the current release, the project includes:
- **50+ vehicle retextures**, with many variants covered. Many vehicles have also had their armor, speed and handling values changed - representing faster and stronger vehicles infused with alien technology - such as the XDF Gemini which is capable of insane maneuvers.
- **A plethora of retextured weapons, uniforms, vests, helmets** and **facewear** to match the XDF theme. All weapons have new reload sounds included in the mod, and infantry get anti-xeno munitions to boost damage slightly while sporting cool blue tracers.
 - **Special anti-xeno munitions** for certain vehicles give the XDF a necessary edge in armored combat. Powerful anti-xeno missiles using unstable warheads can destroy even the most powerful vehicles, while special thermobaric rounds can be fired by portable launchers to decimate hostile infantry on the ground.
 - **XDF insignias** and **flags** to represent the various divisions and groups.
 - A **fully configured faction** with 30+ units, groups and crewed vehicles for use in missions.

All units and vehicles can be found under the **Xeno Defence Force** faction in **BLUFOR**. The mod only includes [u]one[/u] small OPFOR faction, the **Pro-Xeno Liberation Alliance**, which serve as rivals to the XDF. The PXLA may receive more gear in future updates, but for alien factions to fight against, __XDF relies on being paired with other mods to fill those gaps.__

Mods listed as dependencies are **required** in order for **XDF** to load properly. The listed Arma DLCs are not necessarily required, but beneficial to avoid DLC watermarks when flying DLC craft or using DLC weapons.

With the **Expeditionary Forces** or **Reaction Forces** CDLCs loaded, additional XDF retextures and equipment will be available from assets in those CDLCs, such as the **Mamba** utility helicopter (RF) or the **Boar FSV/AT/LAAD** variants (EF).
